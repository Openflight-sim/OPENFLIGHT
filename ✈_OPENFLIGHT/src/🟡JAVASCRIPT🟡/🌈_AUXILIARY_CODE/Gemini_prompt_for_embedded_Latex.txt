Please take the answer you provided previously about [Clearly identify the topic or context of the specific answer here, e.g., 'the aerodynamic model description', 'your last response containing the Python code', 'the explanation of coordinate systems'], which includes mathematical notation written in LaTeX format (using $...$ for inline and $$...$$ for display math).

Generate a single, self-contained HTML code block that meets the following requirements:

Content: Include the entire text and raw LaTeX markup from the specified answer within the HTML <body> tags. Use basic HTML tags like <p>, <h3>, <ul>, <li>, <b>, <code> where appropriate to structure the content similarly to the original answer.
Rendering: Embed the necessary JavaScript (using a CDN link) and configuration for MathJax to automatically render the LaTeX notation when the HTML is loaded. Ensure the configuration recognizes both $...$ and $$...$$ delimiters.
Styling: Include basic CSS within <style> tags for good readability (e.g., set a standard font-family, font-size, line-height, text color, heading styles, and some margin or padding for the body).
Format: The output should be a single block of complete HTML code, starting with <!DOCTYPE html> and ending with </html>, ready to be copied and pasted directly into the 'Embed code' feature of Google Sites.
Completeness: Ensure the HTML is well-formed (<!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <body>).
The goal is to create an embeddable HTML snippet that accurately displays the original answer with fully rendered mathematical equations on a Google Sites page."

How to use it:

Copy the text above.
When you have an answer from me that you want to embed, start a new request.
Paste the prompt template.
Crucially, replace [Clearly identify the topic or context of the specific answer here...] with enough detail for me to know which answer you mean. Examples:
"...previously about the detailed aerodynamic model description for OpenFlight.jl..."
"...previously about your explanation of how to embed LaTeX in Google Docs..."
"...previously about the Python code for calculating planetary orbits..."
Or simply "...previously about your last response..." if it's immediately clear.
Send the modified prompt. I should then generate the required HTML code block for you.
